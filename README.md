# MaterialDeck [DEPRECATED]
> MaterialDeck is an extension for Google Chrome and Opera that enhances the appearance of TweetDeck to meet the standards of Google's Material Design.
> Material Deck is no longer under active development. Tweetdeck has too many style updates that keeping up to date with them all has proved too much of a maintenance issue.
